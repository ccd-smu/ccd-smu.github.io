Click on the icons to find out more tidbits about this festival!\\n\\nThe legend: Huang Jing destroys the Devil of Plague\\nAccording to the legend, a devil of the plague took residence in the Ruhe River during the East Han Dynasty. It brought death and sickness to the people living around the area. Huang Jing was a man who also fell sick from the plague but eventually recovered. Determined to put an end to this, he embarked on a long journey to the eastern part of China in search of an immortal. The immortal was moved by his perseverance and taught him how to get rid of the devil which would appear again on the ninth day of the ninth month. Following the immortal’s advice, Huang Jing went home and sent everyone up a mountain with a Zhu yu leaf and chrysanthemum wine. When the devil of the plague climbed out of the river, it was assaulted with the scents of the Zhu Yu and chrysanthemum and began to feel dizzy. Huang Jing dispatched the devil with ease and since that day, mountain climbing became one of the customs of the festival.\\n\\nThe Festival\\nThe Double Ninth Festival (also known as Chongyang Festival) takes place on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. This festival can be traced back all the way to the Warring States Period where people climb mountains, eat Chongyang cakes (a nine layer cake shaped like a tower), drink chrysanthemum wine and admire the chrysanthemum blossoms. Since 1989, the Chinese government had set this day as the “Senior Citizen’s Festival”. Government agencies and the street community will organise autumn trips to scenic watersides or mountains for the seniors. It is also a time for family get-togethers and for the younger generation to show their love and appreciation for the older generation.

Scholars have found that many Chinese perceive the rituals and customs that they practice as a daily part of their lives with no clear relation to any institutional religious teachings. As such, many do not consider themselves to be affiliated with a single religion. \\n\\nIn reality, most Chinese practice some form of folk religion while a minority identify with the other five religions officially recognised by the state namely: Buddhism, Taosim, Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam. Breakdown of the population according to their religious affiliations is as shown in the chart above. Some ethnic minority groups also practise religions unique to their ethnicity, such as Benzhuism by the Bai people, and Bimoism by the Yi people.
