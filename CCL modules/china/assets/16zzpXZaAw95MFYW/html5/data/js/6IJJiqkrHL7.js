He had advised the emperor to strike an alliance with the state of Qi so as to fend off the threat of the Qin state. Unfortunately, the emperor interpreted this advice as treasonous and banished Qu Yuan from the court. During his exile, Qu Yuan composed a prolific amount of poetry which documented his anguish of being away from his homeland. Years later, the Qu’s homeland was defeated by the Qin state. When Qu heard the news, he jumped into the Miluo River in despair. \\nWhen the villagers in the area learnt of Qu Yuan’s drowning, they quickly raced out to the river in their boats to search for him. Despite their desperate efforts, the villagers were unable to find his body. They began to throw sticky rice dumplings and other food into river in an attempt to keep the fishes from eating him. This eventually evolved to the present practice of eating rice dumplings and organising dragon boat races in remembrance of Qu Yuan’s great patriotism for his country.\\n\\nAbout the Festival\\nThe dragon boat festival takes place on the 5th day of the 5th month according to the Chinese lunar calendar. One of the most well-known activity associated with this festival is the dragon boat race which takes place in many parts of the world such as Hang Zhou, Suzhou, Uk, US and Canada. The glutinous rice dumplings (zong zi) is also an integral part of this festival. Although the fillings differ from region to region (northern dumplings are sweet while the southern dumplings are savory), all dumplings contain glutinous rice wrapped and steamed in bamboo leaves.
