He began to observe that many people were suffering from chilblains on their ears with festering wounds during the harsh winter months. To help relieve the commoners of their discomfort, Zhang set up a medical shed and made boiled dumplings - mutton with pepper and Chinese medicine wrapped into dough. After taking these dumplings, the ears of many people were cured. Since the dumplings were shaped like ears, the people called these dumplings as “jiaoer”, which evolved to become the jiao zi we are familiar with today. From then on, eating jiao zi during the winter solstice became a tradition amongst the Chinese. \\n\\nThe Festival\\nThe Dongzhi Festival, also known as the Winter Solstice Festival, takes place around 22 December each year. As early as 476 BC, ancient Chinese was able to discern the shortest day of the year by observing the length of the shadows. It became recognised as the “Dongzhi Festival” during the Han Dynasty and grew in importance during the Tang and Song Dynasty, where emperors decree as a day for worship and offer sacrifices to their gods and ancestors. Today, celebrating Dongzhi has become a time where family members get together to make tang yuan (glutinous rice balls cooked in sweet or savory soup) in the south, or meat dumplings in the north. The festival also serves as a reminder that an individual is now a year older and should strive to do better in the coming year.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":519}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":607,"height":1821,"strokewidth":0}},"width":607,"height":1821,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6haPaW2B5md"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":515,"yPos":22,"tabIndex":2,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":307,"rotateYPos":404.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":2,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":614,"height":809,"strokewidth":0}},"width":614,"height":809,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":615,"bottom":809,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":518}}},"id":"6FW59DIGsWW"},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"image","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"","imagelib":[{"kind":"imagedata","assetId":159,"id":"01","url":"story_content/61BCDTv2J3u_35_DX1720_DY1720.swf","type":"normal","altText":"Background.png","width":513,"height":862,"mobiledx":0,"mobiledy":0}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":1,"yPos":-4,"tabIndex":1,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":256,"rotateYPos":430,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":3,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":512,"bottom":860,"altText":"Background.png","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":521}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":512,"height":860,"strokewidth":0}},"width":512,"height":860,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"66mBGEFwGpW"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
