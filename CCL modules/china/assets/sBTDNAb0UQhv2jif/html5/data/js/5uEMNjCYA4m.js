The earliest written records of Chinese medicine is the Huangdi Nei Jing (The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic) from the 3rd century BCE. Other two notable books in the world of TCM which focuses on the use of herbs and drugs is the Shanghan Lu (Treatise on Cold Injuries) by Zhang Zhongjing and the Bencao Gangmu (Herbal Essential Details) by Li Shizhen.\\nThe underlying principle of TCM is to restore or maintain the harmonious balance between the Yin (passive) and Yang (active) forces in the human body. Any upset to the equilibrium between these two forces will result in an illness. Wu Xing - Earth, Fire, Wood, Water and Metal are the elements that equate to every phenomena the human body experiences. During a consultation, a TCM practitioner will mobilise the use of smell, hearing, sight, touch, as well as pulse taking to make an assessment regarding the cause of the patient’s ailment.

During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi, an influential Chinese philosopher started a certain ritual of drinking tea and is known as the “tea immortal”. This art of drinking tea was further developed later by others such as Lu Yu, a Chinese tea master and writer during the Tang Dynasty. He is regarded as the Sage of Tea for his book on “The Classic of Tea” (Cha Jing), the first formal works on cultivating, making and drinking tea with details on the implements and ingredients used.\\nSteps to Brewing Chinese Tea\\nCleanse and warm the tea set by pouring boiling water over it. Then drain the teapot and teacups.\\nPut the appropriate amount of tea leaves in the tea pot (depending on the type of tea leaves and your preference of strong or lighter tasting tea)\\nPour hot water into the tea pot. After a few seconds and pour away the first brew. This is to wash away any harmful residues on the surface of the tea leaves\\nPour in hot water up to 4/5 of the teapot and let the tea leaves steep for about 5 minutes. The longer the steeping time, the stronger the tea will taste.\\nPour the tea into the “gong dao bei” (fairness pitcher). The brewing time of certain black teas, like Oolong is very short. The time taken to pour the tea from the first cup to the last cup would result in a difference in taste and intensity. Pouring the tea into a fairness pitcher before pouring into individual teacups would ensure the same intensity of tea across all the teacups.\\nServe the tea on a tea tray to your guest.\\nObserve the color and savour the fragrance of the tea before drinking it.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":470}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":1214,"height":1871,"strokewidth":1}}}],"width":1214,"height":824,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"5afkrOEkdMy","variables":[{"kind":"variable","name":"_state","type":"string","value":"_default","resume":true},{"kind":"variable","name":"_disabled","type":"boolean","value":false,"resume":true},{"kind":"variable","name":"_stateName","type":"string","value":"","resume":true},{"kind":"variable","name":"_tempStateName","type":"string","value":"","resume":false}],"actionGroups":{"ActGrpClearStateVars":{"kind":"actiongroup","actions":[]}},"events":[{"kind":"ontransitionin","actions":[{"kind":"exe_actiongroup","id":"_player._setstates","scopeRef":{"type":"string","value":"_this"}}]}]}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":35,"yPos":113,"tabIndex":1,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":613.5,"rotateYPos":124.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":1,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":1227,"height":249,"strokewidth":0}},"width":1227,"height":249,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":1227,"bottom":249,"altText":"Scroll
