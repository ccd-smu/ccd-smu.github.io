    <p style="font-size: 22px; padding: 50px 0"><b>Internal</b> locus of control refers to people who believe that outcomes and <b>their success and failures are the result of their own actions and efforts</b> (Rotter, 1966). It can be defined as the events and outcomes which can be influenced by <b>people’s own beliefs and actions</b> (Ng, Sorensen, &amp; Eby, 2006). Similarly, individuals with internal locus of control believe that they are <b>able to control and manage their own lives by making decisions about the events</b> (James &amp; Wright, 1993). Additionally, Hsu (2011) found that individuals with high internal locus of control <b>accept that their achievements and failures depend on their own efforts and endeavours or briefly they have ability to determine their own outcomes and they are responsible for what happened.</b>

    <p style="font-size: 22px; padding: 20px 0"><b>External</b> locus of control refers to the <b>beliefs that chance, fate, managers, supervisors, organizations and other persons are more powerful to make decision about individual’s lives and outcomes</b> (Rotter, 1966). Indeed people with perceived external locus of control believe that fate, chance, and luck, friends, and managers determine the outcomes which they themselves experience; so, <b>they contribute their successes, failures and outcomes to external sources</b> (James &amp; Wright, 1993). Hsu (2011) proposed that people with <b>external locus of control believe that external elements such as luck, chance and destiny are stronger to determine their lives, and their failures or successes are not due to their own efforts.</b>

    <p style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 20px;"><b>Remember that you always have the ability to change your situation.</b> There is no situation that you are in that you can’t improve through your own personal action. Sure, it might seem hopeless at the moment, but there are better roads forward from here, no matter what the situation.</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 22px"><b>Make a list of possible actions you can take in response to a difficult situation.</b> Everyone faces serious challenges at some point in their life. Rather than looking at that challenge as an impenetrable wall, instead look for things you can to to handle this difficult situation. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Stop focusing on things that you cannot control about a situation, and when you catch yourself doing it, think instead about the aspects of the situation that you <i>can</i> control.</b> There are factors in every situation that you can’t control. You can’t control the personalities and responses of others. You can’t control natural events or physical accidents. So stop worrying about those things, because you can’t do much about them. Instead, look at what you can control – your responses to those situations, how you handle your emotions, and the daily choices you make. The better your responses and choices, the less impact those negative things you can’t control will have.</p>
